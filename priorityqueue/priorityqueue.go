/*Package priorityqueue implements a series of performant, concurrency safe data structures
used for priority queues.

Hierarchical Queue - O(1) priority queues for large amounts of small integers, linked lists, any values interface{}
Hierarchical Heap - O(log n) priority queue for large amounts of data, slower than HQ but has no limitations.
