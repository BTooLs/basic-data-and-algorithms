/*LadderQueue An O(1) amortized, Priority Queue Structure for Large-Scale Discrete Event Simulation

It an improved Sorted-discipline Calendar Queue (SCQ) and Lazy Queue structure,
Inspired from papers [Ladder queue: An O (1) priority queue structure for large-scale discrete event simulation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/234787413_Ladder_queue_An_O_1_priority_queue_structure_for_large-scale_discrete_event_simulation)
We will use timestamps as Priorities, for a more broad scope

Basically, the structure consists of three tiers: a sorted linked list called
Bottom; the middle layer, called Ladder, consisting of several rungs of buckets
where each bucket may contain an unsorted linked list; and a simple unsorted
linked list called Top

The Ladder Queue [8] is a variant of the Calendar Queue
which is more suited for skewed distributions of the timestamps
of the events, thanks to the possibility of dynamically
splitting an individual bucket in sub-intervals (i.e. sublists
of records) if the number of elements associated with the
