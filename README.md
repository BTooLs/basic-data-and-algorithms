# Basic data structures and algorithms in Go ![](https://travis-ci.org/BTooLs/basic-data-and-algorithms.svg?branch=master)
Learning Go and TDD while making efficient concurrent algorithms and data structures.

The package is meant to be used as a library. If you have any advice/tip please let me know (ex: open an issue).

### Data
**Stack** - basic stack (LIFO) using the builtin linked list, can store any type, concurrency safe, no size limit, implements Stringer.
